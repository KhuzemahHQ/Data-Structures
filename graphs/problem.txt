You have been hired by a new company called 4Run. 4Run delivers packages
from one warehouse to the other. You are hired to make sure that all packages
are delivered the most efficient way and running costs are reduced. The
company is being operated in an underdeveloped area where road connectivity
is low.
Warehouses are connected by roads. Whenever there is a package to be
delivered, you have to take into account which will be the shortest path from
one warehouse to the other. Thanks to all the Data Structures youâ€™ve been
studying you know how to design a system that takes in the locations and their
connections (path), and outputs the best possible way to deliver these
packages 4Run :)
In this assignment you are given one file Graph.py that contains 5 functions.
Throughout each task you will be implementing the functions on the same file
and testing your code. Throughout the assignment you can create helper
functions as you deem fit. You are NOT allowed to use external libraries to
implement your graph algorithms.
